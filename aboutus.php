          Welcome to the PSG Family of institutions of which PSGIM is a
          valuable member!! Let there be charity, so that other people can
          share my family’s prosperity” were the inspiring words from Shri
          P. S. Govindaswamy Naidu who laid the foundation for one of the
          most respected charitable trusts in the country,
          http://www.psgsonscharities.org/ Nine years before an independent
          India emerged, this thought-seed was planted to further the cause
          of education and the first polytechnic was started under the aegis
          of the trust. That was the beginning and the acorn today is a
          magnificent oak tree of excellence in learning.
